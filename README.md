How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Ensuring our software is functional and secure comes down to following professional best practices and utilizing our team to our advantage. Feedback and iteration are key to sound software development.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Considering feedback from both the client and the team you’re working with is a good start to gathering requirements and determining the needs of the product. Iterate on the information given and keep presenting until they’re happy with what you’ve delivered.

How do I approach designing software?
The last couple of terms have taught me to approach software from a modular standpoint and to think critically about the problem in front of me. Always start at the requirements and never cut corners on development time, no matter how pressed you are. A choppy product will never pan out over time, and you’re going to have to pay forward that technical debt eventually.
